# Day 2 â€“ Python Script to check if the file or directory exists

Welcome to Day 2 of 99 Days of DevOps. On Day 1, we discussed about OS Module 

Now the main question is why you want to check if the file or directory exists?

Checking If the file exists or not is very important, as you want to make sure that file exists before you open it or before you are writing to that file, or before you overwrite that file. In Python, there are different ways to check whether the file exists, but I am going to cover three main topics

1- open()
2- os.path()
3- pathlib
